# Introduction
Simulations of bilayer Kitaev model with Gamma and Heisenberg term interactions.

The Kitaev model was solved exactly (Kitaev et al) 

Siefert et al studied the Kitaev bilayer without additional interactions

This model has anyon solutions which could used in topological quantum computing applications 

# Simulations
The bandstructure of the majorana modes is calculated numerically 

# Methodology
Use mean field theory to analyse model, as detailed in (Smith et al 2002)
